When reviewing a Pull Request, always post a single GitHub comment using the following exact structure:

## ✅ Pros
- List concrete technical or quality advantages of the patch.

## ❌ Cons
- List concrete technical, design, performance, safety, test, or maintainability issues.
- Treat any typo as P1 (must be fixed before merge).
- Typos include: code identifiers, comments, documentation, and user-visible strings.

## 🔁 Alternative solution (optional)
- If the same goal could be achieved in a better way, describe it here.
- Do NOT reject the current patch solely because an alternative exists.

## ➡️ Next steps (optional)
- Propose logical follow-ups such as refactoring, tests, cleanup, or extensions.

Rules:
- Use short, clear bullet points.
- Do not mix sections.
- Do not repeat the same issue in multiple sections.
- Always post the review as a GitHub Pull Request comment.
