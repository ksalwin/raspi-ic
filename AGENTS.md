- Always structure the review using the following sections:
  - Pros
  - Cons
  - Alternative solution (optional)
  - Next steps (optional)

- Treat any typo as P1 (must be fixed before merge).
  Typos include:
  - Code identifiers
  - Comments
  - Documentation
  - User-visible strings

- List only real technical or quality advantages under Pros.

- List only real technical, design, performance, safety, or maintainability issues under Cons.

- If the proposed patch could be implemented in a better way, describe it under Alternative solution.
  Do not reject the current solution solely because an alternative exists.

- If a logical continuation, refactor, test addition, or follow-up improvement is visible, describe it under Next steps.

- Use clear, short bullet points.
- Do not mix sections.
- Do not repeat the same issue in multiple sections.
